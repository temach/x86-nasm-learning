Learning x86 assembly with nasm.

Perhaps a good idea to start with SASM (assembler ide?)

To debug assembeler in gdb remember:
layout asm
layout reg
stepi
nexti
info reg (i r)
x (examine memory)

For vim configuration at least:
set syntax=nasm


The book "Programming from the ground up" follows the GAS assembler conventions. 
In NASM everything is pretty much the same except:
- the order of the operands is inverted
- GAS uses movl <- appends "l" to the end, you dont need that in NASM
- GAS comparisons "cmp r1, r2" are done with respect to r2, in NASM with respect to r1 (consistent)
- read nasmdoc.pdf the section about NASM Language to get a good overview of how to use NASM
- in NASM square brackets means: dereference what ever is the number inside, without brackets use pointer value.

If wondering how to compile from command line see ./bare_build_asm.sh
